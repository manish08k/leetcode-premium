Given an array of integers `nums`, you are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:

	- Remove a **strictly increasing** subsequence from the array.

Your task is to find the **minimum** number of operations required to make the array **empty**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [5,3,1,4,2]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

We remove subsequences `[1, 2]`, `[3, 4]`, `[5]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5]

**Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [5,4,3,2,1]

**Output:** 5

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`

	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
