You are given two integer arrays `startTime` and `endTime` of length `n`.

	- `startTime[i]` represents the start time of the `i^th` employee.

	- `endTime[i]` represents the end time of the `i^th` employee.

Two employees `i` and `j` can interact if their time intervals **overlap**. Two intervals are considered overlapping if they share **at least one** common time point.

A team is **valid** if there exists **at least one** employee in the team who can interact with every other member of the team.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum** possible size of such a team.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** startTime = [1,2,3], endTime = [4,5,6]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

	- For `i = 0` with interval `[1, 4]`.

	- It overlaps with `i = 1` having interval `[2, 5]` and `i = 2` having interval `[3, 6]`.

	- Thus, index 0 can interact with all other indices, so the team size is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** startTime = [2,5,8], endTime = [3,7,9]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

	- For `i = 0`, interval `[2, 3]` does not overlap with `[5, 7]` or `[8, 9]`.

	- For `i = 1`, interval `[5, 7]` does not overlap with `[2, 3]` or `[8, 9]`.

	- For `i = 2`, interval `[8, 9]` does not overlap with `[2, 3]` or `[5, 7]`.

	- Thus, no index can interact with others, so the maximum team size is 1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** startTime = [3,4,6], endTime = [8,5,7]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

	- For `i = 0` with interval `[3, 8]`.

	- It overlaps with `i = 1` having interval `[4, 5]` and `i = 2` having interval `[6, 7]`.

	- Thus, index 0 can interact with all other indices, so the team size is 3.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n == startTime.length == endTime.length <= 10^5`

	- `0 <= startTime[i] <= endTime[i] <= 10^9`
