Given the `root` of a binary tree and a `leaf` node, reroot the tree so that the `leaf` is the new root.

You can reroot the tree with the following steps for each node `cur` on the path **starting from the **`leaf` up to the `root`​​​ **excluding the root**:

	- If `cur` has a left child, then that child becomes `cur`'s right child.

	- `cur`'s original parent becomes `cur`'s left child. Note that in this process the original parent's pointer to `cur` becomes `null`, making it have at most one child.

Return *the new root **of the rerooted tree.*

**Note:** Ensure that your solution sets the `Node.parent` pointers correctly after rerooting or you will receive "Wrong Answer".

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], leaf = 7
**Output:** [7,2,null,5,4,3,6,null,null,null,1,null,null,0,8]
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], leaf = 0
**Output:** [0,1,null,3,8,5,null,null,null,6,2,null,null,7,4]
```

**Constraints:**

	- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 100]`.

	- `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`

	- All `Node.val` are **unique**.

	- `leaf` exist in the tree.
