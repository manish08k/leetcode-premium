You are given a 2D array `grid` of size `m x n`, and an integer `k`. There are `k` cells in `grid` containing the values from 1 to `k` **exactly once**, and the rest of the cells have a value 0.

You can start at any cell, and move from a cell to its neighbors (up, down, left, or right). You must find a path in `grid` which:

	- Visits each cell in `grid` **exactly once**.

	- Visits the cells with values from 1 to `k` **in order**.

Return a 2D array `result` of size `(m * n) x 2`, where `result[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the `i^th` cell visited in the path. If there are multiple such paths, you may return **any** one.

If no such path exists, return an **empty** array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,2]], k = 2

**Output:** [[0,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,2],[0,2],[0,1]]

**Explanation:**

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,0,4],[3,0,2]], k = 4

**Output:** []

**Explanation:**

There is no possible path that satisfies the conditions.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= m == grid.length <= 5`

	- `1 <= n == grid[i].length <= 5`

	- `1 <= k <= m * n`

	- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= k`

	- `grid` contains all integers between 1 and `k` **exactly** once.
