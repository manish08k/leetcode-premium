Table: `Calls`

```
+--------------+----------+
| Column Name  | Type     |
+--------------+----------+
| caller_id    | int      |
| recipient_id | int      |
| call_time    | datetime |
| city         | varchar  |
+--------------+----------+
(caller_id, recipient_id, call_time) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains caller id, recipient id, call time, and city.
```

Write a solution to find the **peak** calling **hour** for each `city`. If **multiple hours** have the **same** number of calls, all of those hours will be recognized as **peak hours **for that specific city.

Return *the result table ordered by **peak calling hour** and *`city`* in **descending****** **order.*

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** 
Calls table:
+-----------+--------------+---------------------+----------+
| caller_id | recipient_id | call_time           | city     |
+-----------+--------------+---------------------+----------+
| 8         | 4            | 2021-08-24 22:46:07 | Houston  |
| 4         | 8            | 2021-08-24 22:57:13 | Houston  |  
| 5         | 1            | 2021-08-11 21:28:44 | Houston  |  
| 8         | 3            | 2021-08-17 22:04:15 | Houston  |
| 11        | 3            | 2021-08-17 13:07:00 | New York |
| 8         | 11           | 2021-08-17 14:22:22 | New York |
+-----------+--------------+---------------------+----------+
**Output:** 
+----------+-------------------+-----------------+
| city     | peak_calling_hour | number_of_calls |
+----------+-------------------+-----------------+
| Houston  | 22                | 3               |
| New York | 14                | 1               |
| New York | 13                | 1               |
+----------+-------------------+-----------------+
**Explanation:** 
For Houston:
  - The peak time is 22:00, with a total of 3 calls recorded. 
For New York:
  - Both 13:00 and 14:00 hours have equal call counts of 1, so both times are considered peak hours.
Output table is ordered by peak_calling_hour and city in descending order.
