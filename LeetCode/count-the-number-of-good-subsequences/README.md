A **subsequence** of a string is good if it is not empty and the frequency of each one of its characters is the same.

Given a string `s`, return *the number of good subsequences of* `s`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "aabb"
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** The total number of subsequences is `2^4. `There are five subsequences which are not good: "**aab**b", "a**abb**", "**a**a**bb**", "**aa**b**b**", and the empty subsequence. Hence, the number of good subsequences is `2^4-5 = 11`.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "leet"
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:** There are four subsequences which are not good: "**l*ee***t", "l**eet**", "**leet**", and the empty subsequence. Hence, the number of good subsequences is `2^4-4 = 12`.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** s = "abcd"
**Output:** 15
**Explanation:** All of the non-empty subsequences are good subsequences. Hence, the number of good subsequences is `2^4-1 = 15`.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`

	- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
