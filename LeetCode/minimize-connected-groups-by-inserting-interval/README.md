You are given a 2D array `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represents the start and the end of interval `i`. You are also given an integer `k`.

You must add **exactly one** new interval `[startnew, endnew]` to the array such that:

	- The length of the new interval, `endnew - startnew`, is at most `k`.

	- After adding, the number of **connected groups** in `intervals` is **minimized**.

A **connected group** of intervals is a maximal collection of intervals that, when considered together, cover a continuous range from the smallest point to the largest point with no gaps between them. Here are some examples:

	- A group of intervals `[[1, 2], [2, 5], [3, 3]]` is connected because together they cover the range from 1 to 5 without any gaps.

	- However, a group of intervals `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` is not connected because the segment `(2, 3)` is not covered.

Return the **minimum** number of connected groups after adding **exactly one** new interval to the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,3],[5,6],[8,10]], k = 3

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

After adding the interval `[3, 5]`, we have two connected groups: `[[1, 3], [3, 5], [5, 6]]` and `[[8, 10]]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = [[5,10],[1,1],[3,3]], k = 1

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

After adding the interval `[1, 1]`, we have three connected groups: `[[1, 1], [1, 1]]`, `[[3, 3]]`, and `[[5, 10]]`.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`

	- `intervals[i] == [starti, endi]`

	- `1 <= starti <= endi <= 10^9`

	- `1 <= k <= 10^9`
