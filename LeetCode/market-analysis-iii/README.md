Write a solution to find the **top seller** who has sold the highest number of** unique** items with a **different** brand than their favorite brand. If there are multiple sellers with the same highest count, return all of them.

Return *the result table ordered by* `seller_id` *in **ascending** order.*

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** 
Users table:
+-----------+------------+----------------+
| seller_id | join_date  | favorite_brand |
+-----------+------------+----------------+
| 1         | 2019-01-01 | Lenovo         |
| 2         | 2019-02-09 | Samsung        |
| 3         | 2019-01-19 | LG             |
+-----------+------------+----------------+
Orders table:
+----------+------------+---------+-----------+
| order_id | order_date | item_id | seller_id |
+----------+------------+---------+-----------+
| 1        | 2019-08-01 | 4       | 2         |
| 2        | 2019-08-02 | 2       | 3         |
| 3        | 2019-08-03 | 3       | 3         |
| 4        | 2019-08-04 | 1       | 2         |
| 5        | 2019-08-04 | 4       | 2         |
+----------+------------+---------+-----------+
Items table:
+---------+------------+
| item_id | item_brand |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | Samsung    |
| 2       | Lenovo     |
| 3       | LG         |
| 4       | HP         |
+---------+------------+
**Output:** 
+-----------+-----------+
| seller_id | num_items |
+-----------+-----------+
| 2         | 1         |
| 3         | 1         |
+-----------+-----------+
**Explanation:** 
- The user with seller_id 2 has sold three items, but only two of them are not marked as a favorite. We will include a unique count of 1 because both of these items are identical.
- The user with seller_id 3 has sold two items, but only one of them is not marked as a favorite. We will include just that non-favorite item in our count.
Since seller_ids 2 and 3 have the same count of one item each, they both will be displayed in the output.
