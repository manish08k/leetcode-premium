We know that `4` and `7` are **lucky** digits. Also, a number is called **lucky** if it contains **only** lucky digits.

You are given an integer `k`, return* the *`k^th`* lucky number represented as a **string**.*

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** k = 4
**Output:** "47"
**Explanation:** The first lucky number is 4, the second one is 7, the third one is 44 and the fourth one is 47.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** k = 10
**Output:** "477"
**Explanation:** Here are lucky numbers sorted in increasing order:
4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444, 447, 474, 477. So the 10^th lucky number is 477.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** k = 1000
**Output:** "777747447"
**Explanation:** It can be shown that the 1000^th lucky number is 777747447.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= k <= 10^9`
