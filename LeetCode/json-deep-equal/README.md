Given two values `o1` and `o2`, return a boolean value indicating whether two values, `o1` and `o2`, are **deeply equal**.

For two values to be **deeply equal**, the following conditions must be met:

	- If both values are primitive types, they are **deeply equal** if they pass the `===` equality check.

	- If both values are arrays, they are **deeply equal** if they have the same elements in the same order, and each element is also **deeply equal** according to these conditions.

	- If both values are objects, they are **deeply equal** if they have the same keys, and the associated values for each key are also **deeply equal** according to these conditions.

You may assume both values are the output of `JSON.parse`. In other words, they are valid JSON.

Please solve it without using lodash's `_.isEqual()` function

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** o1 = {"x":1,"y":2}, o2 = {"x":1,"y":2}
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The keys and values match exactly.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** o1 = {"y":2,"x":1}, o2 = {"x":1,"y":2}
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Although the keys are in a different order, they still match exactly.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** o1 = {"x":null,"L":[1,2,3]}, o2 = {"x":null,"L":["1","2","3"]}
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The array of numbers is different from the array of strings.
```

**Example 4:**

```
**Input:** o1 = true, o2 = false
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** true !== false
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= JSON.stringify(o1).length <= 10^5`

	- `1 <= JSON.stringify(o2).length <= 10^5`

	- `maxNestingDepth <= 1000`
