Given a string `s`, return *the number of substrings that have only **one distinct** letter*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "aaaba"
**Output:** 8
**Explanation: **The substrings with one distinct letter are "aaa", "aa", "a", "b".
"aaa" occurs 1 time.
"aa" occurs 2 times.
"a" occurs 4 times.
"b" occurs 1 time.
So the answer is 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 8.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "aaaaaaaaaa"
**Output:** 55
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`

	- `s[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.
