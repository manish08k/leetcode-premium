You are given an integer array `nums`.

Splitting of an integer array `nums` into **subarrays** is **valid** if:

	- the *greatest common divisor* of the first and last elements of each subarray is **greater** than `1`, and

	- each element of `nums` belongs to exactly one subarray.

Return *the **minimum** number of subarrays in a **valid** subarray splitting of* `nums`. If a valid subarray splitting is not possible, return `-1`.

**Note** that:

	- The **greatest common divisor** of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.

	- A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty part of an array.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [2,6,3,4,3]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We can create a valid split in the following way: [2,6] | [3,4,3].
- The starting element of the 1^st subarray is 2 and the ending is 6. Their greatest common divisor is 2, which is greater than 1.
- The starting element of the 2^nd subarray is 3 and the ending is 3. Their greatest common divisor is 3, which is greater than 1.
It can be proved that 2 is the minimum number of subarrays that we can obtain in a valid split.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [3,5]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We can create a valid split in the following way: [3] | [5].
- The starting element of the 1^st subarray is 3 and the ending is 3. Their greatest common divisor is 3, which is greater than 1.
- The starting element of the 2^nd subarray is 5 and the ending is 5. Their greatest common divisor is 5, which is greater than 1.
It can be proved that 2 is the minimum number of subarrays that we can obtain in a valid split.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** nums = [1,2,1]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** It is impossible to create valid split.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`

	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
