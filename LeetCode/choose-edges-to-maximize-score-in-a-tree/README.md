You are given a **weighted** tree consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

The tree is **rooted** at node `0` and represented with a **2D** array `edges` of size `n` where `edges[i] = [pari, weighti]` indicates that node `pari` is the **parent** of node `i`, and the edge between them has a weight equal to `weighti`. Since the root does **not** have a parent, you have `edges[0] = [-1, -1]`.

Choose some edges from the tree such that no two chosen edges are **adjacent** and the **sum** of the weights of the chosen edges is maximized.

Return *the **maximum** sum of the chosen edges*.

**Note**:

	- You are allowed to **not** choose any edges in the tree, the sum of weights in this case will be `0`.

	- Two edges `Edge1` and `Edge2` in the tree are **adjacent** if they have a **common** node.
	
		- In other words, they are adjacent if `Edge1` connects nodes `a` and `b` and `Edge2` connects nodes `b` and `c`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** edges = [[-1,-1],[0,5],[0,10],[2,6],[2,4]]
**Output:** 11
**Explanation:** The above diagram shows the edges that we have to choose colored in red.
The total score is 5 + 6 = 11.
It can be shown that no better score can be obtained.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** edges = [[-1,-1],[0,5],[0,-6],[0,7]]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** We choose the edge with weight 7.
Note that we cannot choose more than one edge because all edges are adjacent to each other.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `n == edges.length`

	- `1 <= n <= 10^5`

	- `edges[i].length == 2`

	- `par0 == weight0 == -1`

	- `0 <= pari <= n - 1` for all `i >= 1`.

	- `pari != i`

	- `-10^6 <= weighti <= 10^6` for all `i >= 1`.

	- `edges` represents a valid tree.
