You are asked to design a simple order management system for a trading platform.

Each order is associated with an `orderId`, an `orderType` (`"buy"` or `"sell"`), and a `price`.

An order is considered **active** unless it is canceled.

Implement the `OrderManagementSystem` class:

	- `OrderManagementSystem()`: Initializes the order management system.

	- `void addOrder(int orderId, string orderType, int price)`: Adds a new **active** order with the given attributes. It is **guaranteed** that `orderId` is unique.

	- `void modifyOrder(int orderId, int newPrice)`: Modifies the **price** of an existing order. It is **guaranteed** that the order exists and is *active*.

	- `void cancelOrder(int orderId)`: Cancels an existing order. It is **guaranteed** that the order exists and is *active*.

	- `vector<int> getOrdersAtPrice(string orderType, int price)`: Returns the `orderId`s of all **active** orders that match the given `orderType` and `price`. If no such orders exist, return an empty list.

**Note:** The order of returned `orderId`s does not matter.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

["OrderManagementSystem", "addOrder", "addOrder", "addOrder", "getOrdersAtPrice", "modifyOrder", "modifyOrder", "getOrdersAtPrice", "cancelOrder", "cancelOrder", "getOrdersAtPrice"]

[[], [1, "buy", 1], [2, "buy", 1], [3, "sell", 2], ["buy", 1], [1, 3], [2, 1], ["buy", 1], [3], [2], ["buy", 1]]

**Output:**

[null, null, null, null, [2, 1], null, null, [2], null, null, []]

**Explanation**

OrderManagementSystem orderManagementSystem = new OrderManagementSystem();

orderManagementSystem.addOrder(1, "buy", 1); // A buy order with ID 1 is added at price 1.

orderManagementSystem.addOrder(2, "buy", 1); // A buy order with ID 2 is added at price 1.

orderManagementSystem.addOrder(3, "sell", 2); // A sell order with ID 3 is added at price 2.

orderManagementSystem.getOrdersAtPrice("buy", 1); // Both buy orders (IDs 1 and 2) are active at price 1, so the result is `[2, 1]`.

orderManagementSystem.modifyOrder(1, 3); // Order 1 is updated: its price becomes 3.

orderManagementSystem.modifyOrder(2, 1); // Order 2 is updated, but its price remains 1.

orderManagementSystem.getOrdersAtPrice("buy", 1); // Only order 2 is still an active buy order at price 1, so the result is `[2]`.

orderManagementSystem.cancelOrder(3); // The sell order with ID 3 is canceled and removed from active orders.

orderManagementSystem.cancelOrder(2); // The buy order with ID 2 is canceled and removed from active orders.

orderManagementSystem.getOrdersAtPrice("buy", 1); // There are no active buy orders left at price 1, so the result is `[]`.

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= orderId <= 2000`

	- `orderId` is **unique** across all orders.

	- `orderType` is either `"buy"` or `"sell"`.

	- `1 <= price <= 10^9`

	- The total number of calls to `addOrder`, `modifyOrder`, `cancelOrder`, and `getOrdersAtPrice` does not exceed 2000.

	- For `modifyOrder` and `cancelOrder`, the specified `orderId` is **guaranteed** to exist and be *active*.
