Given a digit string `s`, return *the number of **unique substrings **of *`s`* where every digit appears the same number of times.*

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** s = "1212"
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The substrings that meet the requirements are "1", "2", "12", "21", "1212".
Note that although the substring "12" appears twice, it is only counted once.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** s = "12321"
**Output:** 9
**Explanation:** The substrings that meet the requirements are "1", "2", "3", "12", "23", "32", "21", "123", "321".
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`

	- `s` consists of digits.
