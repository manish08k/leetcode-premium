Given a string `s`, your task is to find the length of the **longest self-contained** substring of `s`.

A substring `t` of a string `s` is called **self-contained **if `t != s` and for every character in `t`, it doesn't exist in the *rest* of `s`.

Return the length of the *longest** **self-contained *substring of `s` if it exists, otherwise, return -1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abba"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

Let's check the substring `"bb"`. You can see that no other `"b"` is outside of this substring. Hence the answer is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "abab"

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:**

Every substring we choose does not satisfy the described property (there is some character which is inside and outside of that substring). So the answer would be -1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "abacd"

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

Let's check the substring `"abac"`. There is only one character outside of this substring and that is `"d"`. There is no `"d"` inside the chosen substring, so it satisfies the condition and the answer is 4.

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`

	- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
