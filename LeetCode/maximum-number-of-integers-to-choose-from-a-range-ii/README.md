You are given an integer array `banned` and two integers `n` and `maxSum`. You are choosing some number of integers following the below rules:

	- The chosen integers have to be in the range `[1, n]`.

	- Each integer can be chosen **at most once**.

	- The chosen integers should not be in the array `banned`.

	- The sum of the chosen integers should not exceed `maxSum`.

Return *the **maximum** number of integers you can choose following the mentioned rules*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** banned = [1,4,6], n = 6, maxSum = 4
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** You can choose the integer 3.
3 is in the range [1, 6], and do not appear in banned. The sum of the chosen integers is 3, which does not exceed maxSum.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** banned = [4,3,5,6], n = 7, maxSum = 18
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** You can choose the integers 1, 2, and 7.
All these integers are in the range [1, 7], all do not appear in banned, and their sum is 10, which does not exceed maxSum.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= banned.length <= 10^5`

	- `1 <= banned[i] <= n <= 10^9`

	- `1 <= maxSum <= 10^15`
