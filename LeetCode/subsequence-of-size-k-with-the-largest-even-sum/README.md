You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the **largest even sum** of any subsequence of `nums` that has a length of `k`.

Return *this sum, or *`-1`* if such a sum does not exist*.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [4,1,5,3,1], k = 3
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:**
The subsequence with the largest possible even sum is [4,5,3]. It has a sum of 4 + 5 + 3 = 12.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [4,6,2], k = 3
**Output:** 12
**Explanation:**
The subsequence with the largest possible even sum is [4,6,2]. It has a sum of 4 + 6 + 2 = 12.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** nums = [1,3,5], k = 1
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:**
No subsequence of nums with length 1 has an even sum.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`

	- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

	- `1 <= k <= nums.length`
