You are given a binary array `pattern` and an object `stream` of class `InfiniteStream` representing a **0-indexed** infinite stream of bits.

The class `InfiniteStream` contains the following function:

	- `int next()`: Reads a **single** bit (which is either `0` or `1`) from the stream and returns it.

Return *the **first starting** index where the pattern matches the bits read from the stream*. For example, if the pattern is `[1, 0]`, the first match is the highlighted part in the stream `[0, **1, 0**, 1, ...]`.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** stream = [1,1,1,0,1,1,1,...], pattern = [0,1]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The first occurrence of the pattern [0,1] is highlighted in the stream [1,1,1,**0,1**,...], which starts at index 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** stream = [0,0,0,0,...], pattern = [0]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The first occurrence of the pattern [0] is highlighted in the stream [**0**,...], which starts at index 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```
**Input:** stream = [1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,...], pattern = [1,1,0,1]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The first occurrence of the pattern [1,1,0,1] is highlighted in the stream [1,0,**1,1,0,1**,...], which starts at index 2.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= pattern.length <= 10^4`

	- `pattern` consists only of `0` and `1`.

	- `stream` consists only of `0` and `1`.

	- The input is generated such that the pattern's start index exists in the first `10^5` bits of the stream.
