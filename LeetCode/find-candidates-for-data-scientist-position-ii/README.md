Table: `Candidates`

```
+--------------+---------+ 
| Column Name  | Type    | 
+--------------+---------+ 
| candidate_id | int     | 
| skill        | varchar |
| proficiency  | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(candidate_id, skill) is the unique key for this table.
Each row includes candidate_id, skill, and proficiency level (1-5).
```

Table: `Projects`

```
+--------------+---------+ 
| Column Name  | Type    | 
+--------------+---------+ 
| project_id   | int     | 
| skill        | varchar |
| importance   | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(project_id, skill) is the primary key for this table.
Each row includes project_id, required skill, and its importance (1-5) for the project.
```

Leetcode is staffing for multiple data science projects. Write a solution to find the **best candidate** for** each project** based on the following criteria:

	- Candidates must have **all** the skills required for a project.

	- Calculate a **score** for each candidate-project pair as follows:
	
		- **Start** with `100` points

		- **Add** `10` points for each skill where **proficiency > importance**

		- **Subtract** `5` points for each skill where **proficiency < importance**

		- If the candidate's skill proficiency **equal **to the project's skill importance, the score remains unchanged

Include only the top candidate (highest score) for each project. If there’s a **tie**, choose the candidate with the **lower** `candidate_id`. If there is **no suitable candidate** for a project, **do not return** that project.

Return a result table ordered by `project_id` in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

`Candidates` table:

```
+--------------+-----------+-------------+
| candidate_id | skill     | proficiency |
+--------------+-----------+-------------+
| 101          | Python    | 5           |
| 101          | Tableau   | 3           |
| 101          | PostgreSQL| 4           |
| 101          | TensorFlow| 2           |
| 102          | Python    | 4           |
| 102          | Tableau   | 5           |
| 102          | PostgreSQL| 4           |
| 102          | R         | 4           |
| 103          | Python    | 3           |
| 103          | Tableau   | 5           |
| 103          | PostgreSQL| 5           |
| 103          | Spark     | 4           |
+--------------+-----------+-------------+
```

`Projects` table:

```
+-------------+-----------+------------+
| project_id  | skill     | importance |
+-------------+-----------+------------+
| 501         | Python    | 4          |
| 501         | Tableau   | 3          |
| 501         | PostgreSQL| 5          |
| 502         | Python    | 3          |
| 502         | Tableau   | 4          |
| 502         | R         | 2          |
+-------------+-----------+------------+
```

**Output:**

```
+-------------+--------------+-------+
| project_id  | candidate_id | score |
+-------------+--------------+-------+
| 501         | 101          | 105   |
| 502         | 102          | 130   |
+-------------+--------------+-------+
```

**Explanation:**

	- For Project 501, Candidate 101 has the highest score of 105. All other candidates have the same score but Candidate 101 has the lowest candidate_id among them.

	- For Project 502, Candidate 102 has the highest score of 130.

The output table is ordered by project_id in ascending order.
