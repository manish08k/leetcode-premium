Given the `root` of a binary tree and a node `u` in the tree, return *the **nearest** node on the **same level** that is to the **right** of* `u`*, or return* `null` *if *`u` *is the rightmost node in its level*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,4,5,6], u = 4
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The nearest node on the same level to the right of node 4 is node 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** root = [3,null,4,2], u = 2
**Output:** null
**Explanation:** There are no nodes to the right of 2.
```

**Constraints:**

	- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.

	- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

	- All values in the tree are **distinct**.

	- `u` is a node in the binary tree rooted at `root`.
